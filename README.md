# Contact-Management

This project allows you to store the contact information in the database securely. The administrator can access the contacts list which will also show the locations in the map.

# Tools Used
MongoDB: For the database
Express: Has all of the server code and way to connect to the database. I have used Passport and bcrypt to hash the password. It is very secure through this. You can directly call the store username and password information of admin from the database but for clarity I have just put it in the database.js file. 

Note: You would have to run it locally as Azure does not give me MongoDB under student plan. :)
